Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a protocol for classes which represent a file system
path to be able to provide a path in a lower-level
representation/encoding. Changes to Python's standard library are also
proposed to utilize this protocol where appropriate to facilitate the
use of path objects where historically only ``str`` and/or
``bytes`` file system paths are accepted. The goal is to allow users
to use the representation of a file system path that's easiest for
them now as they migrate towards using path objects in the future.


Rationale
=========

Historically in Python, file system paths have been represented as
strings or bytes. This choice of representation has stemmed from C's
own decision to represent file system paths as
``const char *`` [#libc-open]_. While that is a totally serviceable
format to use for file system paths, it's not necessarily optimal. At
issue is the fact that while all file system paths can be represented
as strings or bytes, not all strings or bytes represent a file system
path; having a format and structure to file system paths makes their
string/bytes representation act as an encoding.

To help elevate the representation of file system paths from their
encoding as strings and bytes to a more appropriate object
representation, the pathlib module [#pathlib]_ was provisionally
introduced in Python 3.4 through PEP 428. While considered by some as
an improvement over strings and bytes for file system paths, it has
suffered from a lack of adoption. Typically the two key issues listed
for the low adoption rate has been the lack of support in the standard
library and the difficulty of safely extracting the string
representation of the path from a ``pathlib.PurePath``
object in a safe manner for use in APIs that don't support pathlib
objects natively (as the pathlib module does not support ``bytes``
paths, support for that type has never been a concern).

The lack of support in the standard library has stemmed from the fact
that the pathlib module was provisional. The acceptance of this PEP
will lead to the removal of the module's provisional status, allowing
the standard library to support pathlib object widely.

The lack of safety in converting pathlib objects to strings comes from
the fact that only way to get a string representation of the path was
to pass the object to ``str()``. This can pose a
problem when done blindly as nearly all Python objects have some
string representation whether they are a path or not, e.g.
``str(None)`` will give a result that
``builtins.open()`` [#builtins-open]_ will happily use to create a new
file.

This PEP then proposes to introduce a new protocol for objects to
follow which represent file system paths. Providing a protocol allows
for clear signalling of what objects represent file system paths as
well as a way to extract a lower-level encoding that can be used with
older APIs which only support strings or bytes.

Discussions regarding path objects that led to this PEP can be found
in multiple threads on the python-ideas mailing list archive
[#python-ideas-archive]_ for the months of March and April 2016 and on
the python-dev mailing list archives [#python-dev-archive]_ during
April 2016.


Proposal
========

This proposal is split into two parts. One part is the proposal of a
protocol for objects to declare and provide support for exposing a
file system path representation. The other part is changes to Python's
standard library to support the new protocol. These changes will also
allow for the pathlib module to drop its provisional status.


Protocol
--------

The following abstract base class defines the protocol for an object
to be considered a path object::

    import abc
    import typing as t


    class PathLike(abc.ABC):

        """Abstract base class for implementing the file system path protocol."""

        @abc.abstractmethod
        def __fspath__(self) -> t.Union[str, bytes]:
            """Return the file system path representation of the object."""
            raise NotImplementedError


Objects representing file system paths will implement the
``__fspath__()`` method which will return the ``str`` or ``bytes``
representation of the path. If the file system path is already
properly encoded as ``bytes`` then that should be returned, otherwise
a ``str`` should be returned as the preferred path representation.


Standard library changes
------------------------

It is expected that most APIs in Python's standard library that
currently accept a file system path will be updated appropriately to
accept path objects (whether that requires code or simply an update
to documentation will vary). The modules mentioned below, though,
deserve specific details as they have either fundamental changes that
empower the ability to use path objects, or entail additions/removal
of APIs.


builtins
''''''''

``open()`` [#builtins-open]_ will be updated to accept path objects.


os
'''

The ``fspath()`` function will be added with the following semantics::

    import typing as t


    def fspath(path: t.Union[PathLike, str]) -> str:
        """Return the string representation of the path.

        If a string is passed in then it is returned unchanged.
        """
        if hasattr(path, '__fspath__'):
            path = path.__fspath__()
        if not isinstance(path, str):
            type_name = type(path).__name__
            raise TypeError("expected a str or path object, not " + type_name)
        return path

The ``os.fsencode()`` [#os-fsencode]_ and
``os.fsdecode()`` [#os-fsdecode]_ functions will be updated to accept
path objects. As both functions coerce their arguments to
``bytes`` and ``str``, respectively, they will be updated to call
``__fspath__()`` as necessary and then peform their appropriate
coercion operations as if the return value from ``__fspath__()`` had
been the original argument to the coercion function in question.

The addition of ``os.fspath()``, the updates to
``os.fsencode()``/``os.fsdecode()``, and the current semantics of
``pathlib.PurePath`` provide the semantics necessary to
get the path representation one prefers. For a path object,
``pathlib.PurePath``/``Path`` can be used. If ``str`` is desired and
no guesses about ``bytes`` encodings is desired to decode to a
``str``, then ``os.fspath()`` can be used. If a ``str`` is desired and
the encoding of ``bytes`` should be assumed to be the default file
system encoding, then ``os.fsdecode()`` should be used. Finally, if a
``bytes`` representation is desired and any strings should be encoded
using the default file system encoding then ``os.fsencode()`` is used.
No function is provided for the case of wanting a ``bytes``
representation but without any automatic encoding to help discourage
the use of multiple ``bytes`` encodings on a single file system. This
PEP recommends using path objects when possible and falling back to
string paths as necessary.

Another way to view this is as a hierarchy of file system path
representations (highest- to lowest-level): path -> str -> bytes. The
functions and classes under discussion can all accept objects on the
same level of the hierarchy, but they vary in whether they promote or
demote objects to another level. The ``pathlib.PurePath`` class can
promote a ``str`` to a path object. The ``os.fspath()`` function can
demote a path object to a string, but only if ``__fspath__()`` returns
a string. The ``os.fsdecode()`` function will demote a path object to
a string or promote a ``bytes`` object to a ``str``. The
``os.fsencode()`` function will demote a path or string object to
``bytes``. There is no function that provides a way to demote a path
object directly to ``bytes`` and not allow demoting strings.

The ``DirEntry`` object [#os-direntry]_ will gain an ``__fspath__()``
method. It will return the value currently found on the ``path``
attribute of ``DirEntry`` instances.


pathlib
'''''''

The ``PathLike`` ABC as discussed in the Protocol_ section will be
added to the pathlib module [#pathlib]_. The constructor for
``pathlib.PurePath`` and ``pathlib.Path`` will be updated to accept
path objects. Both ``PurePath`` and ``Path`` will continue to not
accept ``bytes`` path representations, and so if ``__fspath__()``
returns ``bytes`` it will raise an exception.

The ``path`` attribute which has yet to be included in a release of
Python will be removed as this PEP makes its usefulness redundant.

The ``open()`` method on ``Path`` objects will be removed. As
``builtins.open()`` [#builtins-open]_ will be updated to accept path
objects, the ``open()`` method becomes redundant.


C API
'''''

The C API will gain an equivalent function to ``os.fspath()`` that
also allows bytes objects through::

    /*
        Return the file system path of the object.

        If the object is str or bytes, then allow it to pass through with
        an incremented refcount. All other types raise a TypeError.
    */
    PyObject *
    PyOS_RawFSPath(PyObject *path)
    {
        if (PyObject_HasAttrString(path, "__fspath__")) {
            path = PyObject_CallMethodObjArgs(path, "__fspath__", NULL);
            if (path == NULL) {
                return NULL;
            }
        }
        else {
            Py_INCREF(path);
        }

        if (!PyUnicode_Check(path) && !PyBytes_Check(path)) {
            Py_DECREF(path);
            return PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError,
                                "expected a string, bytes, or path object, not %S",
                                path->ob_type);
        }

        return path;
}


Backwards compatibility
=======================

From the perspective of Python, the only breakage of compatibility
will come from the removal of ``pathlib.Path.open()``. But since
the pathlib module [#pathlib]_ has been provisional until this PEP,
its removal does not break any backwards-compatibility guarantees.
Users of the method can update their code to either call ``str(path)``
on their ``Path`` objects, or they can choose to rely on the
``__fspath__()`` protocol existing in newer releases of Python 3.4,
3.5, and 3.6. In that instance they can use the idiom of
``path.__fspath__() if hasattr(path, '__fspath__') else path`` to get
the path representation from a path object if provided, else use the
provided object as-is.


Open Issues
===========

The name of the protocol's ABC
------------------------------

The name of the ABC being proposed to represent the protocol has not
been discussed very much. Another viable name is ``pathlib.PathABC``.
The name can't be ``pathlib.Path`` as that already exists.


Update os.path to accept path objects?
--------------------------------------

The various functions in ``os.path`` [#os-path]_ could be updated to
accept path objects to make their usage more transparent and make
transitioning to supporting path objects easier. The question becomes,
though, whether such transparent support is desired. Currently the
``os.path`` functions specifically support ``str`` and ``bytes``,
although mixing the two types is not allowed. It would not be
difficult to update the various functions to call ``__fspath__()`` on
the appropriate arguments and to perform no type checking of the
values to implicitly allow for supporting both ``str`` and ``bytes``
values as appropriate.

The question becomes whether users will prefer this opt-out approach
to supporting path objects or a more opt-in scenario. If ``os.path``
gained support for path objects, a signficant majority of
path-accepting APIs will magically work with path objects without any
documentation being updated as long as they are using a new-enough
version of Python. But with an opt-in approach, users would
need to explicitly call a function in the ``os`` module or use the
backwards-compatibility approach to add support, but they would also
then be able to make sure document their support and add
backwards-compatibility as desired.


Rejected Ideas
==============

Other names for the protocol's function
---------------------------------------

Various names were proposed during discussions leading to this PEP,
including ``__path__``, ``__pathname__``, and ``__fspathname__``. In
the end people seemed to gravitate ``__fspath__`` for it being
unambiguous without unnecessarily long.


Separate str/bytes methods
--------------------------

At one point it was suggested that ``__fspath__()`` only return
strings and another method named ``__fspathb__()`` be introduced to
return bytes. The thinking that by making ``__fspath__()`` not be
polymorphic it could make dealing with the potential string or bytes
representations easier. But the general consensus was that returning
bytes will more than likely be rare and that the various functions in
the os module are the better abstraction to be promoting over direct
calls to ``__fspath__()``.


Providing a path attribute
--------------------------

To help deal with the issue of ``pathlib.PurePath`` no inheriting from
``str``, originally it was proposed to introduce a ``path`` attribute
to mirror what ``os.DirEntry`` provides. In the end, though, it was
determined that a protocol would provide the same result while not
directly exposing an API that most people will never need to interact
with directly.


Have ``__fspath__()`` only return strings
------------------------------------------

Much of the discussion that led to this PEP revolved around whether
``__fspath__()`` should be polymorphic and return ``bytes`` as well as
``str`` instead of only ``str``. The general sentiment for this view
was that because ``bytes`` are difficult to work with due to their
inherit lack of information of their encoding, it would be better to
forcibly promote the use of ``str`` as the low-level path
representation.

In the end it was decided that using ``bytes`` to represent paths is
simply not going to go away and thus they should be supported to some
degree. For those not wanting the hassle of working with ``bytes``,
``os.fspath()`` is provided.


A generic string encoding mechanism
-----------------------------------

At one point there was discussion of developing a generic mechanism to
extract a string representation of an object that had semantic meaning
(``__str__()`` does not necessarily return anything of semantic
significance beyond what may be helpful for debugging). In the end it
was deemed to lack a motivating need beyond the one this PEP is
trying to solve in a specific fashion.
